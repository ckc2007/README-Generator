![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

An e-commerce site that interfaces with a retail company's SQL database.

## Description

- This application helps the retail company to manage their inventory by providing api routes that can manage creation, updating, and deleting information related to categories, products and tags. 
- Because of the ever-changing nature of inventory pricing, quantities and products, the company needs a fast and secure way of organizing their SQL database so that they can keep track of all inventory changes. 
- By allowing the inventory manager to quickly update, add and delete data related to all products in the system, the company can quickly adapt to inventory needs and changes without having to sort through large amounts of data or spreadsheets. Data is updated in real time and reflected in teh actual SQL database on the backend of the server. 
- The developer learned about the importance of implementing asynchronous functions in managing the database as well as the proper routing techniques for POST, GET, DELETE and PUT requests..
