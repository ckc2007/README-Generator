![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This application saves notes or code snippets online or as an offline app.

## Description

- This text editor runs either in the browser or offline. It is useful for saving notes or code snippets to an IndexedDB database. It is a full-stack application designed to post and retrieve information from a local database. 
- The application is lightweight and allows for data persistence, which serves the functionality of a note taker style app. 
- When the user visits the deployed website, they can choose to save the PWA style app to their local system to be used offline. 
- The developer was able to implement a full-stack applicaiton file structure that uses client server folder structure, a local database, and implements a webpack build. Information is cached and stored in a local database and is deployed on Heroku.
